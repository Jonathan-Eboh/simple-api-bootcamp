Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Moon data Api!


An application that allows the user to type in a city and recive localized lunar data.

Optimizations:

This one had an interestingly structured return object that I had to spend a little time on untangling. However that lead to high data specificity which was nice.
